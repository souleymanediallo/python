# Treasure Island Game
# Instructions: Your mission is to find the treasure.
#
# In project_3/treasure_island.py:
# Write a program to:
# 1. Print the introduction:
#
# print("Welcome to Treasure Island.")
# print("Your mission is to find the treasure.")
# 2. Give the player a choice of which way to go:
#
# print('''
# You're at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right" ''')
# 3. If they choose "left":

# print("You come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake.")
# print("Type 'wait' to wait for a boat. Type 'swim' to swim across.")
# 4. If they choose "wait":

# print("You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors.")
# print("One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?")
# 5. If they choose "red":

# print("It's a room full of fire. Game Over.")
# 6. If they choose "yellow":

# print("You found the treasure! You Win!")

# 7. If they choose "blue":

# print("You enter a room of beasts. Game Over.")
# 8. If they don't choose any of the 3 colors:

# print("You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over.")
# Hint
# 1. Remember to use the lower()
#    function to convert the user's input to lowercase, because the user could type in "Left", "LEFT", or even "lEfT".
# 2. Remember to use the if/elif/else construct to control the flow of the game.
# 3. Remember to use the print() function to print out the results of the user's choice.
